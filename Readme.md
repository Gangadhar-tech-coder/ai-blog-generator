### Known Issue: YouTube Video Unavailability on Render

> **Problem:**  
> When deployed on platforms like **Render**, YouTube videos may return the following error during title extraction or audio download using `yt-dlp`:
> 
> 
> `ERROR: [youtube] <video_id>: Video unavailable. This content isn’t available. WARNING: The provided YouTube account cookies are no longer valid.`
> 
> **Why This Happens:**  
> YouTube enforces stricter access policies for hosted environments. This results in public videos sometimes being blocked unless browser cookies are supplied—something this app **intentionally avoids** for security and portability reasons.

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Run Locally

To avoid this issue altogether, it’s recommended to **run the project locally**, where YouTube access is typically unrestricted.

---

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sai-krishna-kotha/ai_blog_app.git
    cd ai_blog_app
    ```
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:(in linux)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .myvenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Export Environment Variables to Virtual Environment**: (on linux)

    ``In .env file ``
   ```bash
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
   SECRET_KEY='your_django_secret_key'
   DEBUG=True  # Use False in production
   ```
2. **Apply Migrations (only once)**: (on linux)
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```
4. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
#### Option 2: Use Demo Credentials (Read-Only)

You can try the live demo (hosted on Render) using the following credentials:
```bash
   Username: kothasaikrishna
   Password: 12345
```     
> Due to the YouTube restriction explained above, some features (like video title fetch or transcription) may not work in the demo environment.
